 - "This is a public archaeology project that aims to help spread awareness of the richness of the archaeological artifacts and finds within the Philippines. One of the objectives of this project is to be able to raise familiarity and appreciation for Archaeology and the essence of Filipino culture. We are hopeful that through this site, we’ll be able to plant seeds of interest among the youth who in turn will be able to pursue related studies about Philippine Archaeology."

       - "If the second theory is to be believed, the gold image of Agusan suggests that the prehistoric Filipinos were influenced by the traders from the Hindu-Malayan culture, such as the Majapahit Empire. Visayas, for instance, is said to be named after the last Southeast Hindu Prince Srivijaya."

       - "It was discovered by diggers in an archaeological site in Calatagan, Batangas in 1958, and subsequently donated to the National Museum in 1961."
       - "It is another National cultural treasure dated back from 14th – 16th Century"
       - "This pot is considered as the country’s oldest cultural artifact with pre-Hispanic writing. It is distinct because of the mysterious ancient symbols inscribed on its shoulder."
       - "Previous attempts to decipher the pot failed mostly because of the three major obstacles in translating the inscription: (1) The equivalents of many symbols are unknown; (2) Language is also unknown; and (3) The start and end of words, as well as the consonants of some words, are hard to determine."
       - "In 2008, Dr. Rolando O. Borrinaga of U.P. Manila finally came up with a reliable translation. He concluded that the inscription was written in the old Bisayan language, and the pot was used as a 'native incense burner for the pag-ulî (return) rite to retrieve the soul of a moribund person during the pre-Hispanic era.'"
       - "The following is Borrinaga’s translation:"
      special:
       - "Is it open now for sure? [the gateway to the spirit underworld]/"
       - "Take it as a gain already, dakit [Tag., balete] tree/"
       - "That [the soul] confused you for a mango tree/"
       - "[It] just crossed out of fear [to your domain] alone, is that so?/"
       - "Leave the dakit tree now, will you?/"
       - "Shame/Bring [back] the soul that you [were told to] encounter, okay?"

    - "The earliest prehistoric rock drawings studied extensively were those found at the boundary of Angono and Binangonan, Rizal Province."
    - "One hundred twenty seven human figures scattered on the wall were made by engraving lines using a piece of stone on the surface of the rock shelter."
    - "The figures consist of circular heads, with or without necks set on a rectangular or v-shaped body. The linear arms and legs are usually flexed. Some incisions on the rock wall are triangles, rectangles and circles. Rock art is closely linked with a system of belief of a particular group of people. It is symbolic, not decorative."

    - "It is a kind of ear pendant fashioned from green nephrite (jade) is the characteristic trait of the Early Metal Age."
    - "The simplest is plain but some are decorated with three studs in the form of buds. Sometimes these studs are elongated into long spines or projections."
    - "The ear pendant was made not only from jade but also from shells, clay and stone. The kind of material used for personal ornaments suggests differences in social standing."

    - "Socketed adzes made from bronze are characteristic of the Early Metal Age."
    - "These tools were dated from 300 B.C. to 500 B.C. Clay molds for casting these bronze adzes recovered in the caves indicate that the people during that time reused damaged bronze implements for making socketed adzes."

    - "In the early days, shells were fashioned into tools and ornaments."
    - "The oldest known ornaments made from cone shells were found in the early 1960’s in the grave of an adult male in Duyong Cave in Palawan. A shell disk with a hole in the center was found next to his right ear and a disk with a hole by the edge was found on his chest. The shell ornaments were dated 4854 B.C."
    - "Other personal ornaments such as earrings, anklets, bracelets and beads recovered from grave sites were found together with spoons, dippers and other tools fashioned from shells"
    - "At present, the people of Palawan living near Tabon Caves still fashion bracelets from shells. The boring and polishing of the shell ornaments is done with stone tools."
    - "The shells were found in Cagayan, Palawan, and Sorsogon."
